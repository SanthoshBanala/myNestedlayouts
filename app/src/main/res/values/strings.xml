Another place where you can find plain text is input forms in websites and apps.
        Many social media websites, such as Twitter and Instagram, only let you post captions and tweets as plain text,
        although there are some exceptions, such as hashtags and emoji.
        Therefore, you cannot add any additional formatting to these elements. They are automatically formatted according
        to the standards of the website or app. Older email clients also often have plain text modes, allowing you to
        send messages in plain text.
